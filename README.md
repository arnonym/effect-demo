# effect, sqlfx and effect-http

This is an example application I built to learn some new technologies.

#### 1. Run postgres with docker-compose

`docker-compose up`

#### 2. Install dependencies and run application

```bash
npm ci --force # force for now
npm start
```

#### 3. Open swagger docs and play with the API

http://localhost:3000/docs
